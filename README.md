Project website by Lili and Maira as part of Code First Girls

In this project we aim to build a landing webpage for Maira's start-up business which sells women active-wear.The website will shine and sparkle and have all the exciting features we have discovered throughout the course, including responsive design and social media buttons. But what's more, whoever lands on the website, will feel like buying all the leggins and tops which they offer.
